# A-HA GAME

This is a game that uses colors inspired from the A-Ha video "Take on Me" (and also inspired by a CodePen Challenge).
See if you can get perfect right to the end! Then it wraps and you can do it again.
Press on the color that is not changing.
You can adjust the speed to your linking with the slider at left. All made with [ZIM](https://zimjs.com) that runs on the HTML Canvas powered by JavaScript and CreateJS https://createjs.com

Code creativity with the decentralized storage of [Sia](https://sia.tech/) and ZIM.

## Build the HTML
In order to build the html you can use the npm package `inliner`. Just run the following commands and you will end up with a dist.html that contains everything which you can then upload to Skynet.

```
npm install -g inliner
cat index.html | inliner > dist.html

```
